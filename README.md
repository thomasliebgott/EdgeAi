# VigilantIA

The VigilantIA project is a student project that aims to prototype a low cost image classification solution. The project uses an ESP32-Wrover CAM Board, a camera and an LCD monitor to capture and display images. A simple machine learning model is used for image classification, initially focusing on recognizing the number of people in the image. The classification results are displayed locally on the LCD screen, but the future goal is to transmit them to a remote monitor for remote patient monitoring.
